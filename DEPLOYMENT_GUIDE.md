# 🚀 How to Deploy Your F1 Portfolio

Since you don't have technical tools like `git` or `npm` installed on this system, the easiest way to deploy your website is using **Netlify Drop**. It's free, fast, and requires no coding.

## Option 1: The Easiest Way (Netlify Drop)

1.  **Open your browser** and go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  **Locate your project folder**:
    *   Find the folder: `c:\Users\smand\OneDrive\Desktop\portfolio` on your computer.
3.  **Drag and Drop**:
    *   Drag the entire `portfolio` folder onto the "Drag and drop your site folder here" area on the Netlify page.
4.  **Wait for Upload**:
    *   Netlify will upload your files and instantly give you a live URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`).
5.  **Rename (Optional)**:
    *   Sign up/Log in (free) to claim the site and rename it to something cool like `mandar-f1.netlify.app`.

## Option 2: GitHub (If you want to install tools)

If you want to host it on GitHub Pages properly:

1.  **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2.  **Create a Repo**: Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository.
3.  **Upload Files**:
    *   You can manually upload files via the web interface on GitHub (click "Add file" -> "Upload files").
    *   Drag all your files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `assets/`, etc.) there.
4.  **Activate Pages**:
    *   Go to Repository Settings -> "Pages".
    *   Select "main" branch as the source and click Save.

### ✅ Pre-Flight Check

Before deploying, ensure:
*   All your images are inside the `assets` folder.
*   Your `index.html` is the main file.
*   Clicking links (LinkedIn, Email, GitHub) works locally.

**Ready to Race!** 🏎️💨
