# 🐙 How to Upload to GitHub (Without Git Installed)

Since **Git is not installed** on your computer, you cannot "push" code via the command line. However, you can easily upload it via the browser!

## Step 1: Create the Repository
1.  Log in to your GitHub account: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3.  **Repository name**: Type `portfolio`.
4.  **Public/Private**: Choose "Public" (so people can see your site).
5.  Click **Create repository**.

## Step 2: Upload Your Files
1.  Look for the link that says: *"…or create a new repository on the command line"*. **IGNORE THAT**.
2.  Look for the link below it that says: **"uploading an existing file"**. Click that link.
3.  Open your file explorer on your computer to: `c:\Users\smand\OneDrive\Desktop\portfolio`.
4.  **Select ALL files** (Ctrl+A) and **Drag them** into the GitHub browser window.
    *   *Note: Ensure the `assets` folder is dragged in too!*
5.  Wait for the files to upload.
6.  In the "Commit changes" box at the bottom, type: "Initial upload".
7.  Click **Commit changes**.

## Step 3: Turn on GitHub Pages (Optional - To Host It)
1.  Go to **Settings** (tab at the top of your new repo).
2.  Click **Pages** (in the left sidebar).
3.  Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, select `main` and click **Save**.
4.  Wait a minute, and GitHub will verify your site is live!

**Why this method?**
Because `git` is not installed on your Windows system, this "Drag & Drop" method is the standard way to get code onto GitHub without installing complex tools.
